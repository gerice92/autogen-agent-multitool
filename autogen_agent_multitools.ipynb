    "# Overview: Autogen + tools\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will find an use case of Assistants using agents with the framework Autogen. For this, i created a virtual assistant that handles questions related to weather, currency conversion, based on the guide of [Arjun G](https://blog.arjun-g.com/creating-a-multi-agent-chatbot-using-autogen-an-end-to-end-guide-78b6671a96b4) and expanding the functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also add a new tool in the game to handle questions related to stock market companies, just to show how can we add new functionalities to an existing assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is divided in 4 sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Install dependencies\n",
    "2.   Agent Instantiation\n",
    "3.   Function definition\n",
    "4.   Let's ask some stuff to the assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, i add an extra section \"*Add new functionality: New Tool*\" to show how to add expand the functionalities of the assistant throught a new tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE\n",
    "This is a simple example of use of Agents + tools with Autogen, applied to a virtual assistant. I simplified the solution to work with specific types of questions, so i'm not considering any data validation in the process. This notebook should not be considered a complete solution for a virtual assistant. The main intention of this notebook is to give an overview of how can use LLM applied to different tasks through Autogen, and how to use Tools to enlarge the capabilities of an assistant."
